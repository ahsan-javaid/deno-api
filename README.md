# 🔗 Deno Dynamic Backend API

A lightweight and flexible backend API built with [Deno](https://deno.com/) that supports dynamic RESTful routes and fetches data from either **Neon PostgreSQL** or **Deno KV** based on route paths.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Built using Deno's native HTTP server
- 🧠 Dynamic route handling (`/users`, `/products`, `/anything`)
- 🐘 Uses Neon (PostgreSQL) as the primary relational database
- 💾 Uses Deno KV for key-value storage and fallback
- 🔐 Lightweight and fast, no heavy framework required
